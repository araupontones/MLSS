## Guide to Importing

* Create a zip file with the three datasets (school, teacher, and students). The format of the datasets must be .dta (stata files)
* The names of the .dta files should contain the words school, teacher, and students.
* The files must include the all variables specified by the World Bank (see guide, and data/reference/(...)_vars.csv)


### Importing backend protocol

1. Check that the selected round has not been imported yet (if imported, error, import)
2. Check that the files contain three files and that they are named school, teacher, student
3. Check that the files contain the variables indicated in the guide
4. Save in data/imports/round
5. Append rounds into a panel format
